## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, Iâ€™m Mira. Iâ€™m a high school student with a strong interest in technology and innovation. Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of web development and version control, and I enjoy building tools that solve real problems in education.

Right now, Iâ€™m working on an AI-supported student monitoring system that helps track academic engagement and project progress. I aim to create practical, user-friendly interfaces and explore how technology can improve learning environments.

I believe in starting early, staying curious, and always being open to growth. This is just the beginning of my journey.
